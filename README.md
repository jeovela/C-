C++ Programs 


This repository contains projects built using C++. Below is a brief description of each project.

Project 1: This program simulates Langston's Ant. The rule of Langton’s Ant is very simple: the 
ant is placed onto the board that is filled with white spaces, and starts moving forward. For 
each step forward, the Langton’s ant will follow 2 rules:
  1) If the ant is on a white space, turn right 90 degrees and change the space to black.
  2) If the ant is on a black space, turn left 90 degrees and change the space to white.
After that the ant moves to the next step and continue moving forward. The ant will follow
these rules, and continue moving around the board, until the number of steps runs out.

Project 2: Wrote a game called Zoo Tycoon using classes and inheritance. The game allows players
to run a zoo business. Differenty types of animals cost different prices, have different
maintenace costs and different ROI at the end of each day.

Project 3: Wrote a fantasy combat game using classes and polymorphism.

Project 4: Wrote a game to run a tournament between 2 teams of fighters. Developed containers to hold characters using a linked list structure.
      
Program 5: Wrote a game called Die Hard OKC. Character moves through linked spaces to find a bomb before the building explodes.
